# Day 7: Creating a Shopping List

## Objective
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter items for a shopping list.

## Requirements
- The program should prompt the user to enter items one by one.
- When the user types 'done', the program should stop asking for items.
- The program should then display the complete shopping list.

## Steps
1. **Prompt for Input:**
   - Create an empty list to store the items.
   - Use a `while` loop to continuously ask the user for input until they type 'done'.

2. **Display the List:**
   - After exiting the loop, print each item in the list.
